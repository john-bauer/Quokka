## Getting Started
1) Download the Sketch File
2) Copy its contents into your project, or use it as a global library.
3) Browse available symbols, text, and layer styles and use/customize however you'd like.

## How It Works
If you're familiar with symbols, layer styles, and text styles in Sketch, these patterns should look familiar. Each page comes with some documentation that explains each section and how to use them.

Learn more about material color usage in the official [spec](https://material.io/design/color/the-color-system.html#color-theme-creation) from Google.

## Contributing & Use
Feel free to use in personal or commercial projects. If you have a suggestion or spot any issues, submit a PR or create an issue and I'll check it out. The documentation could definitely use more attention. Quokka is a work in progress, but it's been tested and is ready for use.
